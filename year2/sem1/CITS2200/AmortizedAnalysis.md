# Amortized Analysis
---

Is a variety of worst case analysis, but rather than looking at the cost of doing the operation once, it examines the cost of repeating the operation in a sequence.

We determine the worst case complexity $T(n)$ of operforming a sequence of $n$ operations and report the amortized complexity as $\frac{T(n)}{n}$.
