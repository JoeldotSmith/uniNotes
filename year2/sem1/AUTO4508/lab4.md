#### Distbug

- Garentees Convergence
- Similar to wandering stand point algorith but boundary-following stops only if goal is directly reachable or if future hit point witht next obstable would be closer to goa. This information together with detection of unreachable goal if robot has turned 360° garentees convergence.

- Requires positioning accuracy


##### Algorithm

0. initialize i = 0 and STEP
1. Increment i and **move toward the target** until:
   - The target is reached, Stop.
   - An obstacle is hit. Denote this point $H_i$. Go to step 2.
2. Turn left and follow the obstacle boundary whilst continuously updating freespace to target F and min. value of $d(x, T)(=d\scriptscriptstyle min$$(T))$. Repeat until the following occurs:
   - The target has been reached. Stop
   - The target is visable, $F \geqslant d(x, T)$ **F in target dir.** Mark this as point $L_i$. Go to step 1.
   - A position closer to the goal can be reached: $$d(x, T)-F \leqslant d\scriptscriptstyle min  $- STEP$ $ **F in target dir** denote this point $L_i$. Go to step 1.
   - The robot reached $H_i$ The target is unreachable. Stop



##### Code
Distbug written "pretty clearly" in text book.


```c
int DistBug(int x, int y);
//desired relative goal coord. [mm] x in rob's forward dir.
//return true when goal is reached; false if goal is unreach
