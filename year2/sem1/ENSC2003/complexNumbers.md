# Complex Numbers

#### The Argand Plane ("complex number plane")
- The imaginary part adds another dimension to the representation of a number
- While real-numbers can be represented on a number line, complex numbers need a plane to represent.
- The representaion of z = x+iy is essentially a cartisian representation
- Representation in this place can also be made in a polar format (r, $\theta$)
  - $x = r\cos\theta, y = r\sin\theta$
- r is the magnitude of z and $\theta$ is the angle, or argument.
  - $z = r\cos\theta +ir\sin\theta$
- It turns out that is is equibalent to its exponential form
  - $z = re^{i\theta}$

**Eular equation**
$$
e^{j\theta} = \cos\theta + j\sin\theta
$$

##### Terminology
- Re{z}, the real part of z
- Im{z}, the imaginary part of z
- $|z|$, magnitude of z
- Arg{z}, the angle or argument of z
  
##### Operations on complex numbers
- All traditional operators used on real numbers can be extended
  - $z_1+z_2 = (x_1+x_2)+i(y_1+y_2)$
  - $z_1*z_2 = (x_1x_2-y_1y_2)+i(x_1y_2-x_2y_1)$
  - $\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2}e^{i(\theta_1-\theta_2)}$
