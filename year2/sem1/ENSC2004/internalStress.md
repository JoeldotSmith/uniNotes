# Internal Stresses

Neutral Axis: position in the beam that is neither in tension or compression, located at the centroid of the cross section.

The bending *strain* is proportioned to the location with in the beam.
- large y, larger $\varepsilon$
$$
\varepsilon_b \sim y
$$

The bending *stress* is related to the strain (by E) and also the bending moment:
$$
\theta_b \sim \frac{M*y}{I}\\
$$
Where, I = mass moments of interia.
