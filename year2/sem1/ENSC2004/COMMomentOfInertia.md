# Centre of Mass and Moment of Interia
---
#### Centre of Mass (COM)
Special point for which a system acts as if all its mass is concentrated at a point.

$$x = M_s*x = \sum M_i x_i\\x = 4(2)+3(4)+1(1)\\x = 3.25m$$

$$
y = M_s*y = \sum M_i y_i\\8y= 4(2)+3(4)+1(1)\\
y = 2.635m
$$


#### Mass Moments of Interia (I) (MMOI)

Resistance of an object to a change in its *rotational motion*

$I = \int r^2 dm$, This is continuous form.

##### Radius of gyration

A rotating rigid body can be represented as an equivalent point mass, located at a specific distance from the axis of rotation. (This location doesn't necessarilt correspond to the centre of mass.)

$$
I = M_s k^2
$$
Where $k$ = radius of gyration

##### Parralel axis theorem

$ I_p = I_g +md^2$

Where $I_g$ is the MMOI for object about G, and $md^2$ is the object concentrated at a point at $d$

We can use the parallel axis throrem and radius of gyration to determine the equivalent point mass location with the same MMOI
