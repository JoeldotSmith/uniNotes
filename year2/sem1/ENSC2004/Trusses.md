#### Beam Bending

##### Internal forces
Unlike trusses, beams dont just stretch and compress under load, they bend under transverse loads.

eg.

![alt text](/uniNotes/assets/BeamBendingCont.png)

$$\sum F_x = 0 = -30(3)+B_y(6)\\B_y = 15kN$$
$$\sum F_y = 0 = A_y + B_y -30\\A_y = 15kN$$


Cut the beam into a section.

There is a missing vertical force which is a **internal shear force** on the cut section donoted V.

$$\therefore+\uparrow \sum F_y = 0= A_y -5 +V\\\therefore+\uparrow \sum F_y= 0=(15)-5+V\\\therefore+\uparrow \sum F_y= 0=10+V\\\therefore V = -10$$


Similarly for the cut section there will be an **internal bending moment** (M).

$$+(ac)\sum M = 0=(-10)(1)=5(0.5)+M\\M = 12.5kNm$$

For RHS you will get the same result but opposite direction for static equilibrium.

#### Shear force and bending moment diagrams.

Consider the example above but for an arbitary cut at x.

$$V(x)=\frac{d}{dx}M(x)$$
