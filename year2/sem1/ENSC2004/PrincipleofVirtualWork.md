# Principle of Virtual Work
---
Not in MidSem

So far we have solved static systems by analysing conservation of momentum.

We can also analyse systems using work and energy.

We can consider how much work is done on a system if we allowed it to undergo a virtual displacement.
$$
\delta W = F \delta d
$$ or 
$$
\delta W = M \delta \theta
$$
The sum of all virtual work must be zero for a system in static equilibruim.
